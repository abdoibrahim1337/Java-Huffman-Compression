# Java-Huffman-Compression
HuffmanCoder is a Java program that implements Huffman coding, a popular algorithm used for data compression. Huffman coding is a technique that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, where more frequent characters are assigned shorter codes, resulting in efficient data compression.

## Description

HuffmanCoder is a Java program that implements Huffman coding, a popular algorithm used for data compression. Huffman coding assigns variable-length codes to input characters, optimizing the encoding for more frequent characters and achieving efficient compression of data.

### Features

- **Input Text Processing:** Reads text from an input file and calculates character frequencies.
- **Huffman Tree Construction:** Builds a Huffman tree based on character frequencies.
- **Compression:** Compresses input text using Huffman coding.
- **Decompression:** Decompresses text using Huffman coding.

- ## Usage
- Input your text in the input.txt file.
- Run the program to compress the text.-
- View the compressed output in compressed.txt.
- Run the program again to decompress the text.
- View the decompressed output in decompressed.txt.
